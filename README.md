## 🎯 Purpose

The goal of this repository is to serve as a reference for future students at my school. I aim to help them understand what kinds of projects they will work on and encourage them to keep track of their own progress. While I'm aware that the file organization isn't perfect, this repository is meant to show what I have learned throughout the year.

## 🔍 File Naming Convention

You may notice that some of the folder names are in **Turkish**. This is because the folders were created during class assignments, where Turkish was used as the primary language. While the organization might not follow the strictest conventions, each folder contains different types of web development projects that were part of my curriculum.

This repository includes a variety of web development projects I worked on, including:

- Static websites built with **HTML** & **CSS** 🌐

Each project is organized into its respective folder. Some are categorized by **month** or **type**, while others are under an "unspecified" category due to varying project structures.
