While I'm aware that the file organization isn't perfect, this repository is meant to show what I have learned throughout the year.

## 🔍 File Naming Convention

You may notice that some of the folder names are in **Turkish**. This is because the folders were created during class assignments, where Turkish was used as the primary language. While the organization might not follow the strictest conventions, each folder contains different types of web development projects that were part of my curriculum.
