    <h2>Boxing Debut: A New Beginning</h2>
    <p>
      Evander Holyfield's journey into boxing began at a young age. Born in 1962 in Atmore, Alabama, Holyfield started boxing at the age of 8. His determination was evident early on, as he began training at the local gym, and by 1984, he turned professional after an outstanding amateur career. His first pro fight was a decisive win over Rickey Womack. This marked the beginning of what would become one of the most remarkable careers in heavyweight boxing history.
