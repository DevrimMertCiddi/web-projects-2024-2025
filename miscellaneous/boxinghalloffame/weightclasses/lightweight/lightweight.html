    <h2>Boxing Debut: The Beginning of a Legend</h2>
    <p>
      Roberto Durán, born in 1951 in Panama City, Panama, began his professional boxing career in 1968 at just 16 years
      old. Known for his ferocity in the ring and nickname "Manos de Piedra" (Hands of Stone), Durán’s style was
      aggressive, powerful, and relentless. His debut marked the start of a career that would cement his place as one of
      the sport’s greatest fighters.

  <section id="struggles">
    <h2>Struggles: The Path to Redemption</h2>

    <p>
      One of the most significant struggles Roberto Durán faced was his infamous "No Más" moment during his rematch with
      Sugar
      Ray Leonard in 1980. The fight ended unexpectedly when Durán quit in the eighth round, saying, "No más" ("No
      more").
      This decision shocked the boxing world and tarnished his reputation, overshadowing his earlier accomplishments,
      including his dominance in the lightweight division and his victory over Leonard in their first bout. Off the
      ring,
      Durán also dealt with financial difficulties, personal controversies, and the challenge of maintaining discipline
      in his
      training, which often impacted his performances later in his career.
