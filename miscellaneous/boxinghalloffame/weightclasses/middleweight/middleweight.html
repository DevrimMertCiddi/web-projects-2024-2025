    <h2>Achievements: The Iron Man of Boxing</h2>
    <p>
      Harry Greb is celebrated as one of the greatest middleweights of all time. Known for his aggressive style and
      incredible durability, he compiled an astonishing record of over 300 fights during his career. Greb's ability to
      adapt and dominate in the ring earned him a place among the sport's legends.

    <h2>Struggles: Triumph Over Adversity</h2>
    <p>
      Despite his successes, Greb's career was not without challenges. He fought much of his later career with severely
      impaired vision in one eye, a fact he kept hidden from officials and opponents alike. Tragically, his life was cut
      short in 1926 at the age of 32 following complications from surgery. Greb's resilience and determination continue
      to inspire generations of boxers.
