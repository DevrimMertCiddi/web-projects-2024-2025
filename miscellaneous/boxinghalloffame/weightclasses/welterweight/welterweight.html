    <h2>Struggles: Challenges in and out of the Ring</h2>
    <p>
      Despite his greatness, Robinson faced several struggles throughout his career. His most significant challenge came
      in the late 1950s when his skills began to decline. His attempt to regain the world middleweight title in his
      later years was marked by tough defeats, including a loss to Gene Fullmer in 1957. Robinson also struggled with
      personal issues outside the ring, including financial troubles and a rocky post-retirement period.
