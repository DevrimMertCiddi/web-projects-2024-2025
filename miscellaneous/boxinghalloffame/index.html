      <h1 class="baslik">The History of Boxing</h1>
      <p>
        Boxing, often referred to as "the sweet science," is one of the oldest
        and most enduring sports in the world. Its history stretches back
        thousands of years, evolving from brutal bare-knuckle fighting to the
        refined sport we know today, governed by rules and regulations. The
        sport has deep roots in ancient civilizations, shaped by cultural,
        social, and political factors over the centuries.
      </p>
      <hr />
      <h1>The Queensberry Rules: Shaping Modern Boxing</h1>
      <p>
        The Queensberry Rules, introduced in 1867 by John Graham Chambers and
        endorsed by John Sholto Douglas, the 9th Marquess of Queensberry,
        revolutionized boxing, creating the foundation for the modern sport.
        These rules introduced significant changes aimed at making boxing more
        structured, safer, and appealing to a broader audience. Key elements
        of the Queensberry Rules include:
      </p>

      <h2>Mandatory Use of Gloves:</h2>

      <p>
        Unlike previous bare-knuckle fighting, the Queensberry Rules required
        boxers to wear padded gloves, reducing the risk of severe facial and
        hand injuries.
      </p>

      <h2>Round Structure:</h2>

      <p>
        Matches were divided into timed rounds, typically three minutes each,
        with a one-minute rest between rounds. This change encouraged
        strategy, stamina, and pacing rather than prolonged slugging.
      </p>

      <h2>Ring Size and Boundaries:</h2>

      <p>
        The rules specified the use of a boxing ring with dimensions and
        ropes, keeping the action within a defined area.
      </p>

      <h2>Ten-Count Knockout Rule</h2>

      <p>
        If a fighter was knocked down, they had a ten-second count to get back
        on their feet, or the match would be declared over. This rule helped
        prevent prolonged beatings when one fighter was severely
        incapacitated.
      </p>

      <h2>Weight Classes:</h2>
      <p>
        To ensure fair matchups, the rules established weight categories,
        allowing fighters of similar size and weight to compete against each
        other, reducing mismatched and dangerous bouts.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>The Queensberry Rules gradually gained worldwide acceptance, laying
          the groundwork for the professional boxing we see today. They made
          the sport more organized and respectable, moving boxing from
          bare-knuckle brawls to a strategic competition, focused on skill,
          speed, and endurance.
